SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
Coastal flood warnings, as well as flood watches and flash flood
warnings, remain in effect for portions of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Ophelia was located near latitude 37.1 North, longitude 77.6 West.
Ophelia is moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  The 
center of Ophelia is expected to turn toward the north-northeast 
and northeast, moving across eastern Virginia and the Delmarva 
Peninsula through Sunday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next day or so.  
The post-tropical low is expected to become absorbed by a frontal 
boundary Sunday night or early Monday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ophelia can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1, WMO header WTNT41 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT1.shtml
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated within portions of
Chesapeake Bay and its tidal rivers but should gradually recede
overnight and into Sunday.  For information specific to your area,
please see products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall through Sunday night:
 
Portions of the Mid-Atlantic from Virginia through New Jersey...1
to 3 inches with isolated higher totals up to 5 inches.
 
Across southeastern New York through southern New England...1 to 3
inches.
 
This rainfall may produce localized flash, urban, and small stream
flooding impacts, particularly across the Mid-Atlantic region from
Virginia to New Jersey. Isolated river flooding is possible in areas
of heavier rainfall.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ophelia will continue to affect much of
the east coast of the United States through the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Ophelia.  Future information on this system can be 
found in Public Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center 
beginning at 500 AM EDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT1, WMO header 
WTNT31 KWNH, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ophelia Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162023
1100 PM EDT Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Ophelia appears to have lost its tropical characteristics.  Surface 
observations show a well-defined wind shift associated with a 
frontal boundary extending across eastern Virginia, and the heaviest 
precipitation is now well north of the center, oriented along and 
to the north of the front.  In addition, phase space diagrams based 
on global model fields indicate that the system has entered the 
asymmetric cold-core regime.  Therefore, Ophelia is being declared a 
post-tropical cyclone.  Surface observations indicate that maximum 
winds have decreased to 30 kt, mainly over the ocean well east of 
the center.

With the last bit of convection having been sheared off to the 
north, the center appears to have slowed down since the last 
advisory, and the current estimate is northward at 360/7 kt.  The 
circulation is expected to turn northeastward on Sunday, but also 
become more diffuse while it moves across eastern Virginia and the 
Delmarva Peninsula.  The NHC forecast now shows the low becoming 
absorbed by the nearby frontal boundary by 36 hours.  Maximum winds 
are likely to remain around 30 kt until dissipation, mainly in 
a band to the north of the front off the coast of Long Island.

This is the last tropical cyclone discussion issued by the National 
Hurricane Center on Ophelia.  Future information on Ophelia can be 
found in discussions issued by the Weather Prediction Center 
beginning at 500 AM EDT, under AWIPS header TCDAT1, WMO header 
WTNT41 KWNH, and on the web at www.hurricanes.gov.

 
Key Messages:
 
1. Coastal flooding will continue along portions of Chesapeake Bay 
and its tidal rivers through Sunday.  Refer to statements from your 
local National Weather Service Forecast Office for additional 
information.
 
2. Heavy rainfall from Ophelia may produce localized flash and 
urban flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states 
from Virginia to New Jersey through Sunday.
 
3. Swells generated by Ophelia will affect much of the U.S. east 
coast through the weekend, likely causing life-threatening surf and 
rip currents.

Tropical Storm Philippe Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172023
1100 PM AST Sat Sep 23 2023
 
Philippe is still a disorganized tropical storm.  Geostationary 
satellite imagery shows that deep convection is displaced to the 
northeast of the low-level center.  Recent satellite-derived wind 
data revealed that the surface circulation is still elongated and 
winds in the southwest quadrant are quite weak.  The initial 
intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory, based on the ASCAT 
observations.
 
The tropical storm is moving westward at an estimate 12 kt.  This 
general motion should continue for the next two days, as Philippe 
moves along the south side of a mid-level ridge.  By 60 h, the storm 
should gradually turn to the west-northwest and northwest as it 
reaches a weakness in the ridge.  The latest track forecast is 
similar to the previous advisory through day 3, and has shifted to 
the west and slightly slower at days 4 and 5.

Model guidance suggests Philippe should gradually organize and thus 
slowly strengthen in the next few days.  This is possibly due to 
some mid-level vertical wind shear and upstream dry air.  Beyond day 
3, Philippe is expected to approach a mid- to upper-level trough, 
that should increase deep-layer vertical wind shear, but could also 
increase upper-level difluence.  The intensity guidance generally 
favors some slight intensification during this period.  The latest 
NHC forecast is similar to the previous advisory, and lies slightly 
above the consensus aid, IVCN.
