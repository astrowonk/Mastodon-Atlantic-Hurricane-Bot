DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located 
near latitude 12.0 North, longitude 60.5 West. Beryl is moving 
toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h). A continued quick 
westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next 
few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to 
move across the Windward Islands this morning and across the 
southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late today through Wednesday.
 
Data from the NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 130 mph (215 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Beryl is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Fluctuations in strength are 
likely during the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to remain an 
extremely dangerous major hurricane as its core moves through the 
Windward Islands into the eastern Caribbean. Some weakening is 
expected in the central Caribbean by midweek, though Beryl is 
forecast to remain a hurricane.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).  Grantley Adams International Airport on Barbados
recently reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h) with a gust to
69 mph (111 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
959 mb (28.32 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Beryl can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area beginning early this morning. Potentially catastrophic wind
damage is expected where the core of Beryl moves through portions of
the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada.
 
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.
 
Tropical storm conditions are occurring or imminent in the tropical 
storm warning area.
 
Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
starting this morning for Dominica, and by Tuesday afternoon for
parts of the southern coast of Hispaniola.
 
STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore winds near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane
warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.
 
RAINFALL:  Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of
3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands through this
afternoon. Localized maxima of 10 inches are possible, especially in
the Grenadines and Grenada. This rainfall may cause flash flooding
in vulnerable areas.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Hurricane Beryl, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across the 
Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of 
days. Swells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of 
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the next day or so. These swells are 
expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. 
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Beryl Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022024
500 AM AST Mon Jul 01 2024
 
Beryl appears to be in the late stages of an eyewall replacement
cycle, with the Barbados radar showing a larger eye becoming
dominant with only a small portion of the inner eye left over.
While the earlier aircraft data suggested the system could have
weakened below 105 kt, the recent re-organization seen on radar and
satellite imagery support leaving the initial wind speed at 105 kt.
A pair of aircraft from the Air Force and NOAA should be in the
hurricane later this morning for another assessment of the
intensity and structure.  It should be noted that while Beryl's
maximum winds have slightly decreased overnight, the area of
stronger winds has grown, so the hazards of the hurricane are likely
to affect a larger area.
 
The hurricane continues to move at 280/17 kt, but there are signs
that a west-northwestward turn is beginning.  A faster
west-northwestward motion should occur through mid-week due to Beryl
encountering stronger low-level flow.  The hurricane is forecast to
turn more westward beyond that point due to a strengthening
mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone.  The most notable
change in the long-range guidance is that the bulk of the models is
showing a stronger ridge over the Gulf of Mexico, which keeps Beryl
considerably farther south in those solutions.  This is a pretty big
change from earlier so I don't want to bite off on that evolution
just yet, and the new NHC forecast will just take a step toward the
model consensus for continuity purposes.
 
Beryl has a chance today to re-strengthen now that the eyewall cycle
is close to completion and the vertical wind shear remains low.
Little change was made to the previous forecast in the short term.
However, a marked increase in westerly shear is coming in a couple
of days as the low-level flow increases and the upper-level flow
weakens.  This pattern is likely to cause the hurricane to weaken
over the central Caribbean, although the guidance is in poor
agreement on how much, with the latest cycle showing a weaker Beryl
in the western Caribbean.  There is quite a disparity in the
upper-level pattern shown by the ECMWF and GFS in the long range as
Beryl enters the vicinity, so the new forecast is only slightly
adjusts downward for 48 hours and beyond, remaining above the model
consensus.  It is too soon to discuss what could happen with Beryl
if it makes it into the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Beryl is expected to remain an extremely dangerous major
hurricane when it reaches the Windward Islands this morning. This
is a very dangerous situation and residents in these areas should
listen to local government and emergency management officials for
any preparedness and/or evacuation orders.
 
2. Potentially catastrophic hurricane-force winds, a life-
threatening storm surge, and damaging waves are expected when Beryl
passes over portions of the Windward Islands with the highest risk
of the core in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada
beginning later this morning.  Hurricane Warnings are in effect
for much of the Windward Islands.
 
3. Heavy rainfall and localized flooding are expected across the
Windward Islands today.
 
4. Beryl is expected to remain a powerful hurricane as it moves
across the Caribbean Sea later this week.  A Tropical Storm Watch is
in effect for portions of the southern coast of the Dominican
Republic and Haiti.  Interests elsewhere in Hispaniola, Jamaica, the
Cayman Islands, and the remainder of the northwestern Caribbean
should monitor its progress and additional Watches and Warnings will
likely be required this week.

Chris weakened to a tropical depression a few hours ago and now has 
dissipated over the rugged terrain of eastern Mexico.  Its 
associated remnant trough is still producing a large area of heavy 
rain over portions of eastern Mexico, and that is expected to 
continue for several more hours.  This is the last advisory on Chris 
from NHC.
