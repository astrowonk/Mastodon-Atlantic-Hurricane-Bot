<br/>
Southwestern Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
Another broad area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the <br/>
southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Environmental conditions <br/>
are expected to be conducive for gradual development of this system <br/>
through early next week while it moves slowly west-northwestward or <br/>
northwestward. <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the
Rio Grande
* the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio
Grande to Puerto de Altamira.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area in the United States, 
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor 
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast 
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the 
United States, please monitor products issued by your national 
meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
22.7 North, longitude 94.3 West.  The system is moving toward the
west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A generally westward motion
with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next day or
so, and the system is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern
Mexico by late tonight or early Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some increase in strength is possible before the system
reaches the coast.  The disturbance is forecast to become a tropical
storm later today.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.

The disturbance is quite large, and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km) to the north of the center. 
A WeatherFlow station at Matagorda Bay, Texas, recently reported a 
sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a gust to 47 mph (76 km/h).

The minimum central pressure, based on data from NOAA buoy 42055, 
is 997 mb (29.44 inches).

A National Ocean Service tide station at San Luis Pass, Texas, 
recently reported a water level of 3.8 ft above Mean Higher High 
Water.
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the
Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO
header WTNT41 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce
rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South
Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible.  This rainfall
will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along
with new and renewed river flooding.  Mudslides are also possible
in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding
associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the
National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk
graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero
 
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and
the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded
by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
 
Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft
Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,
please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.
 
In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the
center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore
winds.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area today.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible today and tonight
across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of
Texas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Potential Tropical Cyclone One Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL012024
400 AM CDT Wed Jun 19 2024

Dropsonde observations from an Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft indicate that the circulation of the system is 
gradually becoming better defined.  However, the central convection 
remains rather meager and the system's cloud pattern is still not 
classifiable via the Dvorak technique.  Therefore the disturbance 
still does not meet the requirements of a tropical cyclone and will 
continue to be designated as a potential tropical cyclone at this 
time.  Nonetheless, since the system appears to be on its way to 
developing a well-defined center, it is expected to become a 
tropical cyclone later today.  This also suggested by simulated 
satellite imagery from the ECMWF and GFS models that depict 
increasing and organized deep convection near the center as it 
nears the coastline.

The system is turning westward and the current motion is around 
285/7 kt.  A mid-level ridge extending west-southwestward from a 
strong high over the eastern United States should force the 
disturbance to move on a westward path with increasing forward 
speed.  The track model guidance and model consensus are in good 
agreement on this scenario, and the official forecast is 
similar to the previous NHC track, albeit a bit faster.

The current intensity estimate remains at 35 kt based on 
non-elevated surface observations over the Gulf.  Environmental 
conditions, such as warm SSTs and low vertical shear, appear to 
favor some intensification before landfall.  However, the inner 
circulation is likely to remain somewhat broad, limiting 
strengthening.  The official intensity forecast is the same as the 
previous one and in good agreement with the statistical-dynamical 
Decay-SHIPS guidance.
 
Regardless of the exact track of the low, this system will have a 
large area of heavy rains, moderate coastal flooding and 
tropical-storm-force winds well north of the center.  Importantly, 
the official wind speed probabilities are likely underestimating the 
chances of tropical-storm-force winds along the Texas coast because 
of the unusually large and asymmetric area of strong winds on the 
northern side of the circulation.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Users are reminded not to focus on the exact forecast track of
this system.  The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal
flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center
along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico.
 
2. Rainfall associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One will 
impact large regions of Central America, north across northeastern 
Mexico and into South Texas. This rainfall will likely produce 
considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed 
river flooding. Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely 
in and near areas of higher terrain across the Mexican states of 
Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas, including the cities of 
Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria.

3. Moderate coastal flooding is likely along much of the Texas
Coast through midweek.
 
4. Tropical storm conditions are expected today along portions of 
the Texas coast south of San Luis Pass and along portions of the 
coast of northeastern Mexico within the Tropical Storm Warning area.
