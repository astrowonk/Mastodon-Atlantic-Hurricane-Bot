# Tropical Updates to Mastodon

This grabs the [NHC Atlantic RSS Feed](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutrss.shtml), specifically "Atlantic Basin Tropical Cyclones" from `https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/index-at.xml` and generates automated posts to a Mastodon bot with this data.

Currently [live in testing hosted on vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@nhc_atlantic_bot).
